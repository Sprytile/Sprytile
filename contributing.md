# Contributing to Sprytile

Hi! Thanks for wanting to help out!

There are many ways to contribute to Sprytile, and all are welcome!

- Bug reports / feature issues
- Pull requests
- Documentation

## Bug reports, opening issues

The [issue tracker is open](https://github.com/ChemiKhazi/Sprytile/issues) and I'd love to get your feedback! Whether it's a bug report or a feature request, please feel free to open an issue.
 
If you're not familiar with GitHub, bug reports and suggestions are also welcome on the [Sprytile community board](https://chemikhazi.itch.io/sprytile/community).
 
## Submitting a pull request

* [Fork](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/fork) and clone the repository
* Create a new branch: git checkout -b my-branch-name
* Make your changes
* Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ChemiKhazi/Sprytile/compare)
* Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed.

If you're unfamiliar with how pull requests work, [GitHub's documentation on them](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) is very good.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

* Update the documentation as necessary, as well as making code changes.
* Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.

### Coding Style

[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is preferred, but don't sweat it if your pull request is not exactly formatted to the guide.

## Code of Conduct
 
Sprytile adopts the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) as the [code of conduct](CodeOfConduct.md) for this project.

TL;DR: Heckin' swares okay to a point, slurs and trolls is a fuck off
